# GemGeek

This is ruby gem to collect data from BGG and 

it relies heavilly and was also heavily modified from the gem board-game-gem by AcceptableIce
https://github.com/AcceptableIce/board-game-gem/

Because I needed to make many changes to the original gemm, including play download an much more, I decided to use the code and start a new project. Each file is commented in its header to designate original author

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'gem_geek'
```

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
